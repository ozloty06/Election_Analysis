# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.5, Visual Studio Code, 
<<<<<<< HEAD
An analysis of election data in a CSV file using Python in VS Code, 1.56.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Candidate 1: Charles Casper Stockham
  - Candidate 2: Diana DeGette
  - Candidate 3: Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Candidate 1, Charles Casper Stockham, received 23% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  - Candidate 2, Diana DeGette, received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  - Candidate 3, Raymon Anthony Doane, received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
  - Candidate 2, Diane DeGette, who received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 nuymber of votes.

## Challenge Overview
An additional request from the election commission to complete the audit asks for:
- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

To complete this request, our Python script requires additional for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. These results are to be printed to the command line and saved to our existing election_results.txt file. A written analysis is to accommpany these items to summarize the methods and how the presented data may be of use.
